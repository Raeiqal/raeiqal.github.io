title: "The 1 Week MITx Plan"

This is it, the start (ehh... an "offset start").

## The Plan
Currently have the second half of Week 3 and onwards in MIT's 6.002x 3-part course to go through.
There are a total of 4 weeks in a singular 'part', therefore a total of 12 weeks or 3 months to finish this course in an acceptable university standard pace... **--I HAVE NO TIME FOR THAT!** As you can probably conclude from the title of this post, yes, I plan to finish these 3 months in under a week. Ambitious? Yes - Doable? Maybe - Insane? F\*\*\* YES! To be accurate I'll be starting the 1-week-plan from Week 3.5 like a pussy, so what? Sue me. In their introduction they do say one should spend at least 6 hours a week on the course. Translating that over means to finsih these remaining 8.5 weeks I need to spend 6*8.5 = 51 hours this week just studying. I know these hours are sort of achievable because I've seen just as crazy people achieve this kind of productivity over at the [InterGalaxia guild in Habitica](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/43ae9992-5fbe-45a9-83b5-6607eb506967). Top place per week is usually about ~3000 minutes (50 hours) a week. That's 7.14 hours a day. So what? That's comparable to a regular day at a 9-5 job or a 7-2 school day. True, but this isn't some low-level work you can just clock in and clock out, this is 7.14 hours of painful, frustrating deep work.

## The Setup
I had a test trial going from week 2.5 to week 3.5, it took me roughly 6 hours. I didn't reach my 7.14 hour goal but it was close and I could definitely have gone for longer. However, by the end of those non-continuous 6 hours, I was done, tired, finito. Woke up at 10am, next 4 hours until 2pm, studied. Leisure time for 2 hours, then back on that grind, 4pm-6pm studied. I need a way, a method, a system which allows me to grind for hours with minimal fatigue gain per hour.

1. The first obvious probable solution was the good ol' pomodoro. I don't usually like using it, but those breaks every 25 minutes may help to keep my sanity in-check (and [improve learning efficiency](https://youtu.be/IlU-zDU6aQ0?t=135)). 
2. Energy/snacks/food/water - My mind is telling me yeees! but my bo-ody, my bo-ody is telling me NOOOO! Those 5 minute-breaks mentioned earlier should be partly spent eating and drinking.
3. To combat tiredness will be quite tricky. I could risk a 20-minute power nap - potentially feel energized or accidentally sleeping through hours on end. So it is out in the running for me. My remaining options are to exercise or walk outside for a bit. I'll exercise when I hit the first wall of drowsy, a walk outside for the remaining drowsy walls I come across throughout the day. I don't like coffee so I won't be relying on that.
4. Distractions, distractions, distractions! Easy, this one week, I am only allowed 1 item from the toy chest and that toy is the edX domain alongside a chewed-up limited functioning version of google to help with terminologies, explanations, etc. I'm allowed more toys after I hit my daily quota. Simply put, I can have more fun later in the day with the Internet after going through roughly a week and a bit of 6.002x a day. "B-but what about chores?" I've a set time, every 12pm I have an hour to finish up chore duty, imma sneak
5. Sleep that beautiful ideal 8 hours a day. I've been sleeping for 10 hours a day for the past few weeks, not good for my health and productivity. It's because my sleep cycle gets ruined every 6am due to external issues. Solution? 8 hours of sleep before 6am comes around. At the very end of that burning candle wick, it should say 10pm... hopefully. Going to be a rough time couple of days for sure.

Edit:
20 days later, I'm sorry I failed. I needed a better way to attack this massive workload. It's not something one completes so easily in a few days. I also had depressive and suicidal thoughts a few days after I started this massive undertaking. I just wanted to get away from it all and find comfort somewhere else. I'll return with a new project or even.. projects! I have a few things I need to get done for the remaining 2 weeks before I start. Hope to see you then then when I come back on the 16th of April.
