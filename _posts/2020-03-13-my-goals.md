So many goals, so little time

1. Circuit things
  1.1. Finish [MIT's 3-part Circuit and Electronics course](https://www.edx.org/xseries/mitx-circuits-and-electronics)
  1.2. Write down solutions for chapter 1 of Harvard Professor's [Art of Electronics](https://www.cambridge.org/my/academic/subjects/physics/electronics-physicists/art-electronics-3rd-edition?format=HB&isbn=9780521809269)
  1.3. Start a YouTube channel teaching circuits for struggling students from the POV of a struggling student
2. On a journey to become semi-bilingual by learning Mandarin
  2.1. Practice tone drills. Going to transcribe Mandarin through pinyin to drill my weaknesses in listening.
  2.2. Speak, speak, SPEAK more Mandarin
3. Learn to draw realistic portraits inspired by [Scott Young's blogpost](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/portrait-challenge/)
4. Improve my English writing overall. 
  4.1. I may be able to speak it, but boy does putting down what you say frustrating and difficult. I'll be using William Strunk's [Element of Style](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33514.The_Elements_of_Style) as a reference
  3.2. I hope blogging more will passively improve my English writing repertoire further.
  
That's a lot of things destinations to journey to with so little mental discipline to keep myself on the road. Better get into establishing some solid systems to keep me on track (hey! this blog is one of em systems!)
